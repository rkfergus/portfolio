Hello there! I'm glad you made it. This website is one part portfolio, one part web dev playground, all parts me. I am a recently graduated Sun Devil, where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in European History. I personally host and develop this site - keeping my mind and skills sharp, with the added bonus of having a place to play around with whatever new data input and visualization tool I'm interested in at the moment, a list of which can be found <a href="/projects#data">here</a>. I love taking fact or data from mundane & overwhelming to beautiful & enlightening, and always nuanced.
My education and career are two of the most important things in my life, but they're not everything. If you want to read more about me personally, I've hidden that <a href="/bio">wall of text</a> elsewhere. If you're more interested in my professional life, this is probably <a href="/links">what you're looking for.</a>
